### Features

#### Accessibility â™¿
This site is WCAG complaint. It uses all ARIA needed props and alternatives for visible contents.

#### E2e Tests
This site uses Cypress to E2e tests. Some rules are hard to test with only Jest + Enzime. Cypress solves this problem.

#### PWA basic configs
This site uses multiple favicon icons for PWA install, and a descriptive webmanifest file.

#### Basic CSS animations
This site uses keyframes animations triggered by useEffect.

### Why not redux?
Simple problems require simple solutions, redux is a useful tool, but in simple contexts like
this, can lead to unnecessary code complexity.
